# Lab 5 — Web UI Controlling LED (5-webapp-led)

## Goal

Combine a web interface with hardware control, allowing LED interaction through HTTP requests inside a containerized application.

---

## Why this matters

Modern embedded systems often expose user interfaces through web dashboards.  
Bridging web services with hardware control demonstrates how Linux acts as an orchestration layer between UI and physical devices.

---

## What you will build

A web application running inside a container that can toggle LEDs on the device.

---

## Steps

# WebApp + LED

In this lab we extend the previous web application by integrating LED control.

> [!NOTE]
> Run the following commands on the device

Create and enter a directory:

```sh
device:~$ mkdir webapp-led
device:~$ cd webapp-led
```

Create the main application file:

```sh
vim webapp-led.py
```

[webapp-led.py](webapp-led.py)

Create the HTML interface:

```sh
vim index.html
```

[index.html](index.html)

Create the Dockerfile:

```sh
vim Dockerfile
```

[Dockerfile](Dockerfile)

Create docker-compose file:

```sh
vim docker-compose.yml
```

[docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)

Build the container:

```sh
device:~$ docker build --tag webapp-led:latest .
```

List Docker images:

```sh
device:~$ docker image ls
```

Run using Docker Compose:

```sh
device:~$ docker compose up -d
```

Check running containers:

```sh
device:~$ docker ps
```

Check logs:

```sh
device:~$ docker logs webapp-led
```

Access the web interface from your browser:

http://DEVICE_IP:PORT

Stop container:

```sh
device:~$ docker compose down
```

Return one folder:

```sh
device:~$ cd ..
```

---

## Expected result

The web interface should allow toggling LEDs on and off directly from the browser.

---

## Transition to next lab

Next we extend hardware control by introducing MCU communication through a router interface.
